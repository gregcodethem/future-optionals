Future Optional Betting

Users add an html of a smarkets web address, 
e.g. https://smarkets.com/event/959285/sport/football/premier-league/2018/10/01/bournemouth-vs-crystal-palace-fc

The website will then prompt them for various information, regarding their future bet, such as:
- At what score to place the bet.
- Amount to be bet / offset.
- Minimum odds.

The website is being created using Test Driven Development.  
Functional tests with user stories are in the functional_tests directory.

Unit tests are in tasks/tests/ and will be in other apps as the website develops.
